### Getting Started

####The project contains product and customer review data to generate insights that can guide product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement.

###The data  will be used to identify the products that have the highest number of reviews,total potential revenue by category, relationship between the rating snd discount, number of products listed in each category and more.
